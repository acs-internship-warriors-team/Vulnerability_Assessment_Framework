## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive vulnerability assessment framework designed to provide security analysis and reconnaissance for domains. It consists of a frontend application that interfaces with a backend system to deliver detailed security scan results to the user.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Library:** React.js
- **Framework:** Vite.js
- **Styling:** CSS/MUI
- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **Routing:** React Router

### Backend

- **Framework:** Flask
- **Database:** SQLAlchemy with a PostgreSQL backend
- **API:** RESTful API using Flask-RESTful
- **Security Scanning Tools:**
  - Nikto
  - OWASP ZAP
  - Nessus

## Docker

Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment for deployment. The project uses multiple Docker containers to separate different services such as the frontend, backend, and database.

### Key Benefits of Using Docker

- **Isolation:** Each service runs in its own container, isolated from the others.
- **Portability:** Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, ensuring consistent environments across development, staging, and production.
- **Scalability:** Containers can be easily scaled up or down based on demand.
- **Simplified Deployment:** Docker simplifies the deployment process by packaging all dependencies and configurations together.

## Features and Functionalities

### Home Page

- **Welcome Message:** Introduction to the application.
- **Navigation:** Links to other pages such as the scan page.

### Scan Page

- **Domain Input:** Form to input the domain to be scanned.
- **Scan Results:** Display the scan results in a structured format.
- **Loading Indicator:** Shows a loading indicator while the scan is in progress.
- **Error Handling:** Displays error messages if the scan fails.

### Backend Services

- **Subdomain Enumeration:** Identifies subdomains associated with the input domain.
- **IP Address Enumeration:** Retrieves IP addresses associated with the domain and its subdomains.
- **Port Scanning:** Identifies open ports on the domain.
- **Service and Version Detection:** Detects services running on open ports and their versions.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Uses tools like Nikto, OWASP ZAP, and Nessus to find vulnerabilities.
- **SSL/TLS Scanning:** Analyzes the domainâ€™s SSL/TLS configuration.
- **DNS Records Enumeration:** Retrieves DNS records associated with the domain.
- **WHOIS Information Lookup:** Fetches WHOIS information for the domain.
- **Reverse DNS Lookup:** Retrieves PTR records for IP addresses associated with the domain.
- **Certificate Transparency Logs:** Checks for SSL/TLS certificates issued for the domain.
- **HTTP Headers Analysis:** Analyzes HTTP headers for security configurations.
- **Content Discovery:** Identifies interesting content on the domain.
- **API Token and Key Leakage Detection:** Searches for leaked API tokens and keys.
